# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of the relationship between the amount of drivers, rides, and fares and how these values are effected by the type of city. Each city in the given data set was classified in one of three categories: Rural, Suburban, or Urban. Additionally, through resampling the data into weekly subcategories, additional dataframes and line graphs were created to display the total fares for each week
